# Lannet-Codingtest
This notebook includes the solution of the coding task given by the Lannet Technologies for the Data Science internship from Internshala.
In this task, i have made a simple dataset named 'course_info' that includes the information(Student_Id, Course_Id,start_date, end_date,age) about students enrolling in the course. This dataset is made in excel. It is used to solve the first task of the coding test. For the second task, i have used 'HousingData' dataset from kaggle.
Given below is the description of coding task.

1) Write a function in python that inputs a dataframe and identify which columns have date in them. Using these date columns make new columns which are difference between these columns taking 2 at a time. (for instance if there is date1, date2, date3 columns, output should be like date1-date2, date2-date3, date1-date3).

2) Write a function in python that take dataframe as input and drop columns having Pearson correlation more than 0.85
