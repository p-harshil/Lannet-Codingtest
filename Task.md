# Lannet-Codingtest
This notebook includes the solution of the coding task given by the Lannet Technologies for the Data Science internship from Internshala.
Given below is the description of coding task given.

1) Write a function in python that inputs a dataframe and identify which columns have date in them. Using these date columns make new columns which are difference between these columns taking 2 at a time. (for instance if there is date1, date2, date3 columns, output should be like date1-date2, date2-date3, date1-date3).

2) Write a function in python that take dataframe as input and drop columns having Pearson correlation more than 0.85
